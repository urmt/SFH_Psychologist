## KEY MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS MAPPED TO THERAPY

1. **χ(q) = αC(q) + βF(q)** → Therapy must balance stability (coherence) with growth (fertility)
2. **Qspare determines W** → Available psychological resources determine choice capacity
3. **P(H|E) Bayesian updates** → Belief change requires respecting prior experience
4. **D = 1 + log₂(1 + βF/αC) + τ/Qspare** → Optimal psychological complexity exists
5. **dq/dt = −∇χ + ξ** → Healing follows gradient descent with bounded exploration
6. **ΔP = −s/Qspare** → Client vetoes have permanent weight inversely proportional to resources

## NOTES FOR VERIFICATION

**STUDENT**: Please review each axiom and verify:

1. **Accuracy**: Does the therapeutic translation correctly capture the mathematical principle?
2. **Severity**: Are critical/warning classifications appropriate?
3. **Completeness**: Are there additional axioms from your broader SFH work (Substack, Academia, OSF papers) not captured here?
4. **Therapeutic Relevance**: Do these axioms make practical sense for an AI psychologist?
5. **Violation Patterns**: Are the example violations realistic?

**Particular attention needed on:**
- Axioms A02-A10, A12, A14-A19, A21-A26, A28-A33, A35-A37 (all new)
- Mathematical→Therapeutic translation accuracy
- Any axioms from your unpublished/Substack work not in the December 2025 paper

Once verified, I will implement all 37 into the codebase with corresponding repair templates.
